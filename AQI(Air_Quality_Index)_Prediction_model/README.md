In this project, i have worked on predicting the Air Quality Index of Bangalore city, India. This can be expanded for any country, state or city in the world.

![Air Quality Index](https://previews.123rf.com/images/blueringmedia/blueringmedia2002/blueringmedia200200906/140013522-air-quality-index-chart-with-color-scales-from-good-to-hazardous-illustration.jpg =500x)

The main idea in this case study/project is to find or predict the Air Quality Index, provided the various parameters like the one's below :

T : Average Temperature (°C)
TM : Maximum temperature (°C)
Tm : Minimum temperature (°C)
SLP : Atmospheric pressure at sea level (hPa)
H : Average relative humidity (%)
PP : Total rainfall and / or snowmelt (mm)
VV : Average visibility (Km)
V : Average wind speed (Km/h)
VM : Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h)
VG : Maximum speed of wind (Km/h)
RA : Indicate if there was rain or drizzle (In the monthly average, total days it rained)
SN : Snow indicator (In the monthly average, total days that snowed)
TS : Indicates whether there storm (In the monthly average, Total days with thunderstorm)
FG : Indicates whether there was fog (In the monthly average, Total days with fog)
